  Description:
  This function calculates the address width based on specified RAM depth.
  It can also be used to compute the selection width for a mux.

================================================================================*/


/*
Usage:
    depth : RAM Depth (mux input width)
    out   : Address width (select width)

out = ceil(log2(depth))
*/


function automatic integer clogb2;
	input integer depth;
	for (clogb2=0; depth>0; clogb2=clogb2+1)
		depth = depth >> 1;
endfunction
